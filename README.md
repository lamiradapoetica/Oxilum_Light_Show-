#Oxilum Light Show – Arduino-Powered Installation for Fuego Austral 2025
This project marks my first experience programming an Arduino-based light show, developed for my debut art installation at Fuego Austral 2025, Argentina’s regional Burning Man event.

The installation was designed as a standalone piece placed in an open field, powered by a 12V battery, charged daily via a solar panel, and controlled by an Arduino Uno. The lighting system was programmed to create dynamic visual effects, optimizing sequencing, timing, and power efficiency in an off-grid environment.

This project allowed me to apply logical structuring, coding efficiency, and real-world problem-solving, skills that align with my broader interest in data visualization and analytics.
